# Reload-under-ASAN leak regression for the zstd_dict_file ZSTD_CDict
# lifecycle. Targets the bug class fixed in 0fb40d9 ("Free ZSTD_CDict on
# configuration cleanup to prevent memory leak") and f735a5d ("pass size=0
# to ngx_pool_cleanup_add for dict cleanup handler"): the CDict leak only
# manifests when the configuration is reloaded (SIGHUP), which the normal
# smoke tests never do.
#
# Strategy: start nginx (built with -fsanitize=address) using a dictionary,
# SIGHUP it several times so the old cycle's dict cleanup runs repeatedly,
# then stop nginx cleanly. ASAN's leak detector reports on exit; if the
# CDict (or its cleanup registration) leaks per reload, the run aborts and
# this script exits non-zero.
#
# Usage: tools/test_reload_leak.sh <nginx-binary> [reloads]

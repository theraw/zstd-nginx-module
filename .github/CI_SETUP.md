# CI/CD Pipeline

Automated build, test, and security analysis for the zstd-nginx-module.

## Workflows

The pipeline is split across four workflow files:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`build-test.yml`](workflows/build-test.yml) | Lint/validation, build matrix (nginx mainline + Angie), Perl/Python tests, ASAN/UBSAN |
| [`codeql.yml`](workflows/codeql.yml) | CodeQL `security-extended` analysis |
| [`security-scanners.yml`](workflows/security-scanners.yml) | flawfinder, clang-tidy, semgrep + SARIF upload |
| [`fuzzing.yml`](workflows/fuzzing.yml) | libFuzzer Accept-Encoding parser fuzzing |

Common triggers (`build-test.yml`, `codeql.yml`, `security-scanners.yml`):

- **Push** to `master`, `main`, `dev`
- **Pull requests** to `master`, `main`
- **Weekly schedule** — Monday 04:17 UTC, catches nginx API drift against
  newly released nginx versions even with no commits
- **Manual** — `workflow_dispatch`

Workflow-level hardening:

- `concurrency` — superseded runs on the same ref are cancelled, no pile-up
- `permissions: contents: read` by default; `codeql` and `secure` request
  `security-events: write` only where needed
- `timeout-minutes` on every job — a hung nginx test cannot burn runner hours
- All third-party actions are **pinned to commit SHAs** (see the header
  comment in `build-test.yml`), not floating tags

## nginx versions

| Role | Version | Where |
|---|---|---|
| nginx mainline (default + artifact + tests) | **latest, resolved at run time** | `resolve` job → `needs.resolve.outputs.nginx_version` |
| Angie (nginx fork, also packaged) | **1.11.5** (pinned) | `resolve` job matrix JSON |

nginx is **not pinned**. A `resolve` job scrapes `nginx.org/en/download.html`
for the current mainline release and exposes it as
`needs.resolve.outputs.nginx_version` plus a ready build-matrix JSON; every
other job (`build`, `build-old-libzstd`, `build-asan`, `tests`) consumes those
so the whole run agrees on one version. This keeps the weekly cron testing the
module against new releases as they ship, and avoids 404s once nginx.org drops
an old mainline tarball. `codeql.yml` and `valgrind.yml` resolve the same way
via a per-job "Resolve latest mainline nginx" step. `tools/ci-build.sh` with no
argument resolves the latest too (pass an explicit version to override).

The `build` job uses a dynamic
`strategy.matrix: ${{ fromJSON(needs.resolve.outputs.matrix) }}` (entries with
`flavor`/`version`/`url`/`dir`) so the
module is compiled against both nginx mainline and Angie — the actively
developed fork this module also ships packages for (see
`tools/test_package_artifact.py`). The shared test binary is the nginx
mainline one.

There is **no special "CI module" for nginx** — CI builds nginx from source
with `--add-module` (full binary) or `--with-compat` + nginx-dev headers (for
lint tools). The realistic extra HTTP modules the zstd filter runs alongside
are compiled in so the module is exercised in a real nginx, not a stripped one:
`ssl`, `v2`, `v3`, `gzip_static`, `realip`, `sub`, `addition`, `stub_status`,
`auth_request`, plus `--with-threads` and `--with-file-aio`.

### Debug compile flags

The `build` job configures with full debug flags:

- `--with-debug` — nginx `ngx_log_debug*` logging compiled in
- `-g3` — maximum debug info including macro definitions
- `-O0` — no optimisation, accurate line/variable info
- `-fno-omit-frame-pointer` — reliable gdb/valgrind backtraces
- `-funwind-tables` — unwind info for crash backtraces
- `-DNGX_DEBUG_PALLOC=1` — pool-allocator debug bookkeeping

Module sources additionally get a strict compile pass with
`-Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -Wstrict-aliasing -Wunreachable-code -Wunused
-Wwrite-strings -Werror`.

## Jobs

| Workflow | Job | Depends on | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| build-test | `validation` | — | actionlint, shellcheck, cppcheck, clang static analyzer, Python harness unit tests |
| build-test | `build` | — | Build matrix (nginx mainline + Angie), strict module compile, ccache, upload artifact |
| build-test | `build-asan` | — | Build nginx with `-fsanitize=address,undefined` |
| build-test | `tests` | `build` | Perl `Test::Nginx::Socket` suites + Python end-to-end smoke tests |
| build-test | `tests-asan` | `build-asan` | Re-run smoke tests under ASAN+UBSAN, fail on any memory/UB error |
| codeql | `codeql` | — | GitHub first-party C/C++ security analysis (`security-extended`) |
| security-scanners | `secure` | — | flawfinder, clang-tidy, semgrep — results uploaded as SARIF to the Security tab |

Within `build-test`, `validation`, `build`, and `build-asan` start in
parallel; only `tests`/`tests-asan` wait on their respective build job.
`codeql` and `security-scanners` are independent workflows running in
parallel with it.

### `tests` coverage

- `t/00-filter.t` — filter module Perl suite
- `t/01-static.t` — static module Perl suite
- `tools/test_encoding.py` — truncation, Vary, boundary-size (1900 lines),
  repeated-request, concurrent-request smoke tests
- `tools/test_terminal_frame.py` — empty-output `ZSTD_e_end` terminal-frame
  regression (the bug fixed in `a209f96`)

### Caching

- apt archives per job
- nginx source tarballs keyed by version
- **ccache** for the nginx + module compile, keyed on source/header hashes
- Perl modules (`~/perl5`)
- nginx-dev generated headers
- semgrep rules and pip cache

## Security analysis

Five layers, results surfaced in the GitHub **Security → Code scanning** tab
via SARIF (not just buried in artifacts):

| Tool | Job | Output |
|---|---|---|
| CodeQL (`security-extended`) | `codeql` | SARIF (native) |
| flawfinder | `secure` | SARIF + log |
| semgrep (`p/c`, `p/security-audit`) | `secure` | SARIF + log |
| clang-tidy (`cert-*`, `bugprone-*`, `clang-analyzer-security.*`) | `secure` | log |
| cppcheck / clang static analyzer | `validation` | log artifacts |

ASAN+UBSAN (`tests-asan`) is the runtime memory-safety layer — it directly
targets the lifetime/UB bug classes in this module's history (per-request
context handling, terminal-frame emission).

## Local testing

Build against nginx locally before pushing:

```bash
bash tools/ci-build.sh            # default: latest mainline (resolved from nginx.org)
bash tools/ci-build.sh 1.29.8     # specific nginx version
```

Run the test suites locally (requires `Test::Nginx::Socket`):

```bash
cd t
perl 00-filter.t
perl 01-static.t
python3 ../tools/test_encoding.py --nginx-binary /path/to/nginx
python3 ../tools/test_terminal_frame.py --nginx-binary /path/to/nginx
```

Run the Python harness unit tests:

```bash
cd tools
python3 -m unittest test_test_encoding test_test_package_artifact
```

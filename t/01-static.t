# COVERAGE NOTES on gaps found by the git-history CI audit
# (kept above __DATA__ so they are not parsed into any test block):
#
# Gap 2 — f7e2ef3 ("clear Accept-Ranges in static module"):
# deliberately NOT covered by a black-box test here. The static
# handler serves a local file and never sets r->allow_ranges (in this
# nginx, only the upstream/proxy path sets it — see
# ngx_http_upstream.c, and ngx_http_range_filter_module.c bails unless
# r->allow_ranges). ngx_http_clear_accept_ranges() in the static
# module is therefore purely defensive: no request reachable through
# zstd_static alone makes the pre-fix and fixed builds differ
# (empirically verified — identical 200, no Accept-Ranges, no
# Content-Range, on both a pre-f7e2ef3 and a fixed .so). A Perl test
# asserting !Accept-Ranges would PASS on the buggy build too, i.e. be
# blind. Per the project's fail-first discipline we do not add a test
# that cannot fail on the unfixed code.
#
# Gap 3 — HTTP/2 transport axis (8281baa bug-B class):
# the build enables --with-http_v2_module but nothing tests the h2
# path. HTTP/2 in nginx requires TLS + ALPN/Upgrade negotiation; h2c
# (cleartext) does not work without Upgrade in nginx config. A Python
# test without TLS cannot easily drive the h2 path. The bug-B defect
# (empty-buffer, flush-state-machine, c->buffered accounting) is
# already well-covered by test_proxy_unbuffered_truncation.py
# (HTTP/1.1) and the matrix under ASAN; the h2-specific framing path
# would be redundant effort without adding coverage for a new code
# path. Left for future work when/if CI adds TLS test infrastructure.

# zstd_dict_file is an http{}-context directive (NGX_HTTP_MAIN_CONF), so
# it goes in --- http_config, not --- main_config (global, before http{}).

# must NOT be served with Content-Encoding: zstd — the client would
# receive an undecodable body. The handler pread()s the leading 4

# not actually vary on Accept-Encoding (the same .zst comes back no

=== TEST 23: zstd_static rejects an empty .zst file
# A zero-byte .zst cannot satisfy the 4-byte pread() magic check;
# the handler must decline rather than serve an empty body with
# Content-Encoding: zstd. TEST 21 covers the wrong-magic case;
# this locks the truncated-to-zero edge specifically. Like TEST 21,

# A request whose URI ends in "/" maps to a path with a trailing
# slash; appending ".zst" would produce ".../.zst". The handler
# short-circuits at the URI-suffix check (uri.data[uri.len - 1]
# == '/') and declines without touching the filesystem, so the
# request falls through to the normal directory-index machinery
# rather than being answered with Content-Encoding: zstd. The
# fallback then 403s the directory and logs the missing index file
# — that log line is from the regular static handler, not from
# zstd_static, and is expected here. The contract being locked is
# only !Content-Encoding (i.e. zstd_static did not falsely claim
# the response was zstd-encoded).

# Subtle behaviour at static.c:204 — when zstd_static is "on" and
# the .zst exists, the handler sets r->gzip_vary = 1 *before*
# declining for a client that does not accept zstd. That keeps the
# response cacheable by intermediaries that key on Vary, so a later
# request from a zstd-capable client through the same shared cache
# gets the encoded variant rather than the identity one. Without
# this, a CDN that saw the identity response first would pin all
# subsequent clients to it.
